# PPL-Intro
## What is this class
* CS3323: Principles of Programming Languages
* An introduction  to theoretical foundations  and paradigms  of  programming  languages.  Topics include  basic concepts such  as lexical  analysis,  syntax analysis,  type systems  and semantics,  some practical  issues  such as memory management and exception  handling,  and  programming  paradigms  such  as imperative programming,  object-oriented  programming,  functional  programming  and scripting.
## Course Goals: Two Important Pieces
* This course is meant to provide an experience  for the students  to view  programming  as a goal-oriented  process.  A major component of this  course will  be learning  from one another through  team assignments.  Here  students  will be challenged  to think creatively to synthesize  potential  solutions,  devise  testing  strategies  and integrate  these  solution  into their implementations.
1. Build  confidence  by struggling with challenging problems.
2. Build  relationships  with  your peers  by working together on these problems.
